    - "Halo model and particular extensions described in referenced paper"

explanation: |

    In the non-linear regime (high k; small scales) predicting the matter 
    power spectrum is extremely challenging, as the simple predictability
    of the linear regime no longer applies.

    The Halo model is a formalism for making predictions in this regime.
    It models structure as a collection of randomly-positioned (overlapping) blobs of
    matter with a specified radial density profile (for example the NFW profile).
    The correlation function of matter is then the sum of the correlation within a 
    halo, and the correlation between halos.  The distribution of the masses and radii
    of the halos then specifies a particular realization of the model.

    Mead et al present an optimized variant of the Halo Model, designed to produce
    accurate matter power spectra well into the non-linear regime for a wide
    range of cosmological models. It is designed to fit hydrodynamical simulations
    like the OWLS set of models, and thus account for both non-linear evolution
    and 

    The model has two free input parameters (though these are set to fiducial values
    if they are not otherwise specified).  See Table 2 in Mead et al for the meaning
    of these new parameters.

    Please contact Alexander Mead if you have any difficulties with the code/models itself.
    (Though the CosmoSIS team are of course happy to help with connecting the code 
    into CosmoSIS pipelines).
