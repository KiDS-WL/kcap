explanation: |
        "
        CosmicEmu is an emulator designed to interpolate among a collection
        of numerical N-body simulations called Mira-Titan.

        It uses a Gaussian Process interpolation between a set of simulations
        arranged in a lattice in parameter space.

        Each simulation yields a non-linear matter power spectrum P(k,z), and
        the interpolation is between these spectra, so the output should be a
        reasonable (1% accuracy) value of P(k,z) for the given parameters.

        The simulations and the whole process are explained in detail in the paper
        above.
