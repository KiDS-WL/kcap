I made a few changes to make FrankenEmu fit into cosmosis a little better:

1. Changed the emu function so it returns an error code instead of quitting when a parameter is out of range.

2. Changed emu function to print out value of parameter that is out of range as well as bounds.

3. Added a hubble.h header with struct and declarations
