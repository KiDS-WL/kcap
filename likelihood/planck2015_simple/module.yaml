explanation: |
    "See the Planck2015 module for general information about Planck.

    This module provides a greatly simplified form of the Planck likelihood supplied
    in plik_lite_v18_TT.clik, which should not be used for high-precision cosmology
    but should be alright for e.g. Fisher matrix forecasting.

    It turns the data in that file into just a Gaussian likelihood, ignoring the nuisance
    parameter.

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    data_file: (String; default=data.txt) Text file containing ell in col 1 and TT TE and EE in col 2 (no ell(ell+1) factor)
    covmat_file: (String; default=covmat.txt) Numpy format file containing covariance matrix

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs:
    cmb_cl:
        ell: Integer vector of angular frequencies for CMB spectra
        tt: Double vector of temperature spectra in l*(l+1) C_ell / uK^2 (if using TT data)
        ee: Double vector of E-mode polarization spectra in l*(l+1) C_ell / uK^2 (if using pol data)
        te: Double vector of cross spectra in l*(l+1) C_ell / uK^2 (if using pol data)


outputs:
    likelihoods:
        planck2014_simple_like: (real; only if data_1 specified) Log-likelihood from first file
