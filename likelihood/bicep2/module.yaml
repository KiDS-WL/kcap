assumptions:
    - "CAMB or other CMB code must be set up to do lensing and include high k modes"
    - "BICEP2 2014-03-14 dataset"

explanation: |
    "The 2014 BICEP2 results are a detection of cosmological B-modes
    on the scales that indicate a primordial gravitational wave bump.

    This module wraps the likelihood code released by the BICEP2 team.
