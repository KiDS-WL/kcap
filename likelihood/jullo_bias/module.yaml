    - "COSMOS survey galaxy samples"

explanation: |
    Galaxy bias refers to the relative density of galaxies compared to underlying dark matter,
    and can be a function of scale and/or redshift.

    Jullo et al made measurements of galaxy bias for high and low mass samples.

    This module compares a predicted b(z) or b(k,z) from theory to these measurements.

params:
    mass: "string, low or high.  Choose which Jullo sample to work with"
inputs: 
    bias_field:
        z: "1D real array, redshift of theory samples"
        k_h: "1D real array, optional, wavenumber of samples in k_h. if not present then b(z) only is assumed"
        b: "1D or 2D real array, bias as a function of either k and z or just z"
outputs:
    likelihoods:
        JULLO_LIKE: "real, likelihood of supplied bias model"
