assumptions:
    - "CMB shift parameter as in LCDM"
    - "WMAP9 measurement of parameter"

explanation: |
    "The full WMAP likelihood is slow and requires a full Boltzmann
    integration (also slow) to get the CMB spectra.

    This module uses a lightweight alternative - the CMB shift parameter,
    which can be calculated from background evolution alone.

    This does not provide as much information as the full likelihood.
