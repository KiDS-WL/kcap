explanation: |
    "The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe measured the temperature
    and polarization of the CMB over the full sky in the K, Ka, Q, V, and W
    microwave bands.  

    The WMAP produced this likelihood code, which takes in theory spectra
    for TT, EE, BB, and TE spectra and compares it to WMAP data.

    The method used for the likelihood is different in different ell regimes
    and for different spectra.

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs:
    cmb_cl:
        ell: Integer vector of angular frequencies for CMB spectra
        tt: Double vector of temperature spectra in l*(l+1) C_ell / uK^2 (if using TT data)
        ee: Double vector of E-mode polarization spectra in l*(l+1) C_ell / uK^2 (if using pol data)
        bb: Double vector of B-mode polarization spectra in l*(l+1) C_ell / uK^2 (if using pol data)
        te: Double vector of cross spectra in l*(l+1) C_ell / uK^2 (if using pol data)
