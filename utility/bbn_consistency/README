Sets the helium mass fraction (YHe) from the mean baryon density (ombh2)
and number of neutrinos (delta_neff), based on a table interpolation.

This module should go into the pipeline after consistency and
before any physics modules. It's effectively an optional consistency module.

These are the ini file settings:

[bbn_consistency]
file = cosmosis-standard-library/utility/bbn_consistency/bbn_consistency.py
data = cosmosis-standard-library/utility/bbn_consistency/helium.dat
