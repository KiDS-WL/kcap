This page contains links to data associated with the SDSS-II/SNLS3 Joint
Light-Curve Analysis ([Betoule et al. 2014], submitted to A&A).

Light-curve fit parameters and associated uncertainties for the JLA
SDSS-II/SNLS3 sample are released in the form of a plugin for the
[cosmomc] software. We also deliver an independent c++ code to compute
the JLA likelihood, intermediate products and presentation material.

Download the archive: [jla_cosmo_v2.tgz].

1 Installation of the cosmomc plugin
====================================

  Untar the archive and copy the following files to the corresponding
  cosmomc directory:

  - source/supernovae_JLA.f90
  - data/jla.dataset
  - data/JLA.paramnames
  - data/jla_*

  Add the JLA likelihood in source/supernovae.f90:

  ,----
  | use JLA
  | ...
  | call JLALikelihood_Add(LikeList, Ini)
  `----

  Modify the "SUPERNOVAE =" line of the cosmomc source/Makefile line to
  compile the JLA likelihood:

  ,----
  | SUPERNOVAE = supernovae_Union2.o supernovae_SNLS.o supernovae_JLA.o
  `----

  Depending on your cosmomc installation, you may obtain the same result
  by extracting directly the archive in your cosmomc directory.

  Light-curve parameters are given in file `data/jla_lcparams.txt'.  The
  columns are:
  ,----
  | name: name of the SN
  | zcmb: CMB frame redshift (including peculiar velocity corrections for
  |       nearby supernova based on the models of M.J. Hudson)
  | zhel: Heliocentric redshift (note both zcmb and zhel are needed
  |       to compute the luminosity distance)
  | dz: redshift error (no longer used by the plugin)
  | mb: B band peak magnitude
  | dmb: Error in mb
  | x1: SALT2 shape parameter
  | dx1: Error in shape parameter
  | colour: Colour parameter
  | dcolour: Error in colour
  | 3rdvar: In these files, the log_10 host stellar mass
  | d3rdvar: Error in 3rdvar
  | cov_m_s: The covariance between mb and x1
  | cov_m_c: The covariance between mb and colour
  | cov_s_c: The covariance between x1 and colour
  | set: A number indicating which sample this SN belongs to, with
  |    0 - SNLS, 1 - lowz, 2 - Riess HST 3 - SDSS
  | ra: Right Ascension in degree (J2000)
  | dec: Declination in degree (J2000)
  | biascor: The correction for analysis bias applied to measured magnitudes
  |          (this correction is already applied to mb, original measurements
  |           can be obtained by subtracting this term to mb)
  `----


2 Installation of the C++ likelihood code
=========================================

  The JLA C++ code and data are available from a single archive:
  [jla_likelihood_v3.tgz]. The code prerequisites working implementation
  of LAPACK and BLAS. To compile the static library edit the provided
  makefile to suit your local environment and do:
  ,----
  | make
  `----
  You may also need to adapt the name of lapack routines in jla.cc to
  match the convention of your fortran compiler.

  The compilation of the provided example test depends on the [CLASS]
  CMB code for background computation. To compile this example fill the
  makefile with the path to your local class installation and type:

  ,----
  | make test_jla
  `----

  Running this test should perform an evaluation of the JLA likelihood
  for the best-fit LCDM model. The expected result is approximately
  682.9.

3 SALT2 model
=============

  Version 2.4 of the SALT2 code, is available from the [SALT2 home
  page].  The corresponding data, including the model trained on the JLA
  training sample, and the description of instruments involved in the
  cosmology sample can be downloaded here: [salt2-4_data.tgz]
  (md5:af829c7f177c6037adcbe0a89360464a).

  With this model, the fit of the lightcurves of SNLS 03D4ag (see
  Recalibrated light-curves in native SALT2 format) should return:

  Note: This value of msb is different from the value published in
  Betoule et al. 2014 by -0.0012 because of malmquist bias correction.

4 Error propagation
===================

4.1 Error decomposition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  We deliver separate covariances matrices following the decomposition
  of the error on light-curve parameters proposed in [Betoule et
  al. 2014], Eq. 11. The ordering of the \(3 \times N_{\rm SN} = 2256\)
  vector of light-curve parameters is: \[ \vec \eta = (m^\star_1,
  {X_1}_1, C_1, \cdots, m^\star_{N_{\rm SN}}, {X_1}_{N_{\rm SN}},
  C_{N_{\rm SN}}).  \] The covariance matrix of this vector can be
  assembled as: \[ C_{\vec \eta} = C_{\rm stat} + C_{\rm cal} + C_{\rm
  model} + C_{\rm bias} + C_{\rm host} + C_{\rm dust} + C_{\rm pecvel} +
  C_{\rm nonIa} \] with:
  - \(C_{\rm stat} \): statistical uncertainty (including the
    statistical uncertainty of the SALT2 Model, but not including the
    $\sigma_{\rm coh}$ and $\sigma_{lens}$ of Eq. 13)
  - \(C_{\rm cal} \): calibration uncertainty
  - \(C_{\rm model} \): systematic uncertainty on the model (See [Mosher
    et al. 2014])
  - \(C_{\rm bias} \): uncertainty on the bias correction
  - \(C_{\rm host} \): uncertainty on the fonctionnal form of the
    luminosity-host mass relation.
  - \(C_{\rm dust} \): uncertainty on the Milky Way dust column density
  - \(C_{\rm pecvel}\): uncertainty on the peculiar velocity correction
    (Systematic only: does not include the \(\sigma_z\) term of Eq. 13.)
  - \(C_{\rm nonIa} \): potential contamination by non-Ia.

  The \(3N_{\rm SN}\times 3N_{\rm SN} = 2256\times2256\) matrices are
  provided in [covmat_v1.tgz].

4.2 SALT2 light-curve model uncertainties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  We plan to release shortly material to enable easy propogation of
  calibration and statistical uncertainties affecting the SALT2 model to
  the fit of other SNe samples.


5 Recalibrated light-curves in native SALT2 format
==================================================

  Light curves of SN includes in the cosmology sample:
  [jla_light_curves.tgz] (md5:14f402041003661d284ac18dbcc7ec24).

  It includes:
  - the recalibrated SNLS3 light curve (lc-??D??.list)
  - the recalibrated SDSS-II light-curves (lc-SDSS*.list, subsample of
      [http://sdssdp62.fnal.gov/sdsssn/DataRelease/index.html])
  - Nearby and HST light-curves from the C11 compilation (lc-sn*.list
    and lc-name.list, available from
    [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/snls/])

  Six SNe (sn2005hc, sn2005ir, sn2006nz, sn2006oa, sn2006ob, sn2006on)
  are in common with SDSS and either CfAIII or CSP. The light-curve file
  contains a merge of all available photometry.
