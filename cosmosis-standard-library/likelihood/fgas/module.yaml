    Cluster gas mass fractions are a standard quantity whose value is related
    to the cosmic baryon mass fraction and whose apparent evolution depends
    on the expansion of the Universe.

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    numdatasets: integer, number of fgas data tables
    datasetN with N=1,2,...: String, path to each data file
    cl_cal_mean: real, mean of a Gaussian prior to be applied to the fgas calibration nuisance parameter. This will be deprecated once the gravitational lensing data that we use to direcly constrain this parameter are included in a future version. Default to 0.90 and 0.09.
    cl_cal_sd: real, standard deviation of a Gaussian prior to be applied to the fgas calibration nuisance parameter. This will be deprecated once the gravitational lensing data that we use to direcly constrain this parameter are included in a future version. Default to 0.90 and 0.09.
    fgas_rslope_mean: real, mean of a Gaussian prior to be applied to the power-law slope of the cluster fgas profile. Default to 0.442 and 0.035.
    fgas_rslope_sd: real, standard deviation of a Gaussian prior to be applied to the power-law slope of the cluster fgas profile. Default to 0.442 and 0.035.
    cl_lenssys_mean: real, mean of a Gaussian prior to be applied to the weak lensing calibration nuisance parameter. Default to 1.000 and 0.069.
    cl_lenssys_sd: real, standard deviation of a Gaussian prior to be applied to the weak lensing calibration nuisance parameter. Default to 1.000 and 0.069.
