Angular diameter distance between 2 redshifts. Needs to be implemented in COSMOSIS.

Eliminate constants in favor of setting them consistently with the rest of COSMOSIS. (Pass them to the fgas library code also.)

Eliminate own implementation of rho_crit(z).

Eliminate own interpolation of d(z), H(z).
