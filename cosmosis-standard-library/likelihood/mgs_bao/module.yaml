assumptions:
    - "MGS chi2"
    - "FLRW metric and standard BAO size"

explanation: |
    "This module gives a likelihood of the redshift-distance and redshift-Hubble
    relations in combined form D_v = (da**2 * (1+z)**2 * dr)**(1./3.) 
    where dr = z / H. It uses the sound horizon at last-scatter rs_zdrag and 
    the predicted expansion since last scattering to predict the BAO size
    at the redshifts at which SDSS MGS measured them."
params:
    verbose: "Bool, Print extra output (default = False)"
inputs: 
    distances:
        z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
        d_m: "1D real array, physical angular diameter distance in Mpc"
        h:  "1D real array, hubble parameter with in units of Mpc"
        rz_zdrag:  "real, sound horizon at last scattering in Mpc"
outputs:
    likelihoods:
        MGS_BAO_LIKE: "real, likelihood of supplied expansion history"
