assumptions:
    - "WiggleZ dark energy survey data set"
    - "FLRW metric and standard BAO size"

explanation: |
    "This module gives a likelihood of the redshift-distance and redshift-Hubble
    relations in combined form D_v = (da**2 * (1+z)**2 * dr)**(1./3.) 
    where dr = z / H. It uses the sound horizon at last-scatter rs_zdrag and 
    the predicted expansion since last scattering to predict the BAO size
    at the redshifts at which the WiggleZ survey measured them.

    A correlated Gaussian likelihood is then returned."

    data_file: "string, path to file with measured z - D_v values in (default: included file)"
    weight_file: "string, path to inverse covariance matrix file (default: included file)"
    rs_fiducial: "Real, Fiducial value of sound horizon at last scattering used in making data (default=148.6)"
    verbose: "Bool, Print extra output (default = False)"
