    - "Data supplied in a specific file format"

explanation: |
    "This module implements a general likelihood of tomographic 2-point measuremnts
    of various quantities, including galaxy density, cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments,
    CMB lensing, and the various cross powers between these.

    Since this is a very general problem and there are a great many different configurations
    of such data, this module relies on data being in the self-describing format that 
    is discussed here: https://github.com/joezuntz/2point/
    This format attempts to unambiguously describe the various aspects of a tomographic
    two-point measurement to the point where its likelhood can be generated automatically.

    This module looks up theory measurements in specific sections depending what kind
    of measurement is used. To add more data types to the file please see type_table.txt.

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    data_file: "string. Filename of the 2pt format FITS file to use."
    data_sets: "string, default 'all'. Space-separated list of which data sets from within the file to use for likelihoods."
    covmat_name: "string, default 'COVMAT'. Name of the covariance matrix extension to use in the data file."
    angle_range_{dataset}_{i}_{j}: "String, pair of real numbers. If set, for the given data set and pair of bins, cut down the data used to this angular range  (min and max)"
    cut_{dataset}: "String, Space-separated list of i,j pairs. (no spaces within the pair, just betwen them, e.g. cut_lss = 1,2  1,1  3,4.  Remove this bin from the likelihood."
    covariance_realizations: "Integer, default=-1. If >0, assume that the Covariance matrix was estimated from a set of MC simulations and should thus have the Anderson-Hartlapp factor applied to increase its size. If zero, assume infinite number of realizations."
    sellentin: "Bool, default=F. If set, use the Sellentin-Heavens 2016 change to the likelihood to account for this distribution of the covariance estimates. This changes the likelihood to a student's-t form. Note that this invalidates the simulated data sets used for the ABC sampler."
    save_plot_to: "string. If set, save various plots to the named directory. May not work on all systems."
    like_name: "string, default '2pt'. The name of the likelihood to save."
    kind: "string, default='cubic'. The interpolation to do into the theory splines. See scipy.interpolate.interp1d."
    gaussian_covariance: "bool, default=F, C_ell likelihoods only. Generate a Gaussian covariance matrix for the data."
    survey_area: "real. if gaussian_covariance=T, the sky area of the survey"
    number_density_shear_bin: "real. If gaussian_covariance=T, the number of galaxies per bin in the WL data"
    number_density_lss_bin: "real. If gaussian_covariance=T, the number of galaxies per bin in the LSS data"
    sigma_e_bin: "real. If gaussian_covariance=T, the standard deviation of the intrinsic shape noise in the WL data"
