explanation: |
    "The Planck space telescope has provided the most powerful current
     CMB data from quadrupole to sub-degree scales.

     The Planck Collaboration released a likelihood code (the PLC) to which one passes
     both a file containing the data to be used, the theory spectra to compare to that 
     data, and a set of nuisance parameters that the code uses (somewhat opaquely) to 
     model the effects of foreground components, secondary anisotropies, and Planck beams and 
     gains.  For more details see the papers by the Planck collaboration and web documentation.

     This is for the 2015 data release; various different likelihood files are available from:
     http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#results

     We do not describe the nuisance parameters in detail here; reasonable ranges and values
     for them are given in the Planck papers; they should be marginalized over in full
     analysis.  Different parameters are used for different data sets.

     The cosmosis team wrote the wrapper which connects the PLC into
     cosmosis.

     Important caveats about which likelihood files you can use together, and what priors
     you should use on nuisance parameters, are available here:
