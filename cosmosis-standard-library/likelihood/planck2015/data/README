We have only included two of the smaller Planck 2015 likelihood files here:
    commander_rc2_v1.1_l2_29_B.clik
    plik_lite_v18_TT.clik

If you'd like others you can download them using from:
http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#results
under the "cosmology" then "likelihood" sections.  You probably just want the
COM_Likelihood_Data-baseline_R2.00.tar.gz
file.
