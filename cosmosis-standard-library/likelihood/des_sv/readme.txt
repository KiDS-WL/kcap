The FITS files in this directory contain the DES SV shear-shear data in the 
format described in github.com/joezuntz/2point/ though it should be mostly obvious.

There are two tomographic ones, for the im3shape and ngmix analyses with 3 tomographic bins each.  There are also two 2D files, also one for im3shape and one for ngmix.
