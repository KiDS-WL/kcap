# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    mean: "float, mass in M_sun/h"
    sigma: "float, error in M_sun/h "

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:

inputs:
    clusters:
        M_max:  "real, mass (M_sun/h)"

outputs:
    likelihoods:
        MAXMASS_LIKE: "Gaussian likelihood value of supplied parameters"
