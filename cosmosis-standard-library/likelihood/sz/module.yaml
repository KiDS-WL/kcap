explanation: |
    "This small module was written for CosmoSIS.

    CMB data like that from Planck can be used to make counts of clusters using
    the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, in which hot gas in the clusters scatters
    CMB photons and causes a decrement (below 217 GHz) or increment (above 217 GHz).

    The number of clusters in the universe of a given mass is sensitive to the 
    mass density and the overall amount structure in the universe.  The full calculation
    is very involved, but in a LCDM universe with some assumptions about Halo behaviour
    it can be reduced to a constraint on sigma_8 * Omega_M ** 0.3
