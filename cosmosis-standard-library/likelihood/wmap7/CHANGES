CHANGE LOG FOR V4P1 (7-YEAR DATA) RELEASE
---------------------------------------
D.L.Larson, June 4, 2010

The diagnostic program test.F90 wsa updated to be consistent with the V4P1
release; and lines 660-665 of WMAP_7yr_tetbeebbeb_pixlike.F90, which write
debugging information to a file, were commented out to avoid problems with some
compilers.  Neither change affects the actually likelihood function.


J.Dunkley, E.Komatsu, D.L.Larson, M.R.Nolta, May 27, 2010

** Two small bugs have been fixed, which involve the high-ell TT, TE, TB, and
point source power spectra:

1) The original computation of the TT spectrum used an incorrect monopole
subtraction which resulted in a small amount of excess power at high ell, and a
corresponding elevation of the best-fit residual point source amplitude. 
Correcting the monopole subtraction reduced the high-ell power slightly which
produced a correspondingly lower residual point source amplitude, from 11.0 to
9.0 uK2 sr.

2) Due to a simulation configuration error, the TE fsky recalibration factor
used in version 4.0 was 1.049 instead of the factor 1.011 used in this version.

-- Patch to make the data directory selectable through an environment variable.
   T. Kinser, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Oct 2008
   This patch is available as a separate download from LAMBDA.

---------------------------------------
CHANGE LOG FOR V3 (5-YEAR DATA) RELEASE
---------------------------------------
J.Dunkley, E.Komatsu, D.L.Larson, M.R.Nolta, February 2008

** The 3-year data files and routines have been replaced by 
the 5-year ones.

WMAP_5yr_tt_pixlike.F90
-- The resolution 3 option has been removed. This module supports
only the resolution 4. For a quicker estimation of low-l temperature 
likelihood (with the same precision) the Gibbs sampling is recommended. 
To use the Gibbs sampling (and disable pixlike option), set 
"use_gibbs = .true." in wmap_options.F90.

** The following new routines have been added:

WMAP_5yr_tetbeebbeb_pixlike.F90
-- This module computes the low-l polarization likelihood of
TE/TB/EE/BB/EB spectra. To use this, compile the codes with
"WMAPFLAGS += -DUSE_LOWELL_TBEB" enabled in Makefile, and
call wmap_likelihood_compute(cl_tt,cl_te,cl_tb,cl_ee,cl_eb,cl_bb,like)

WMAP_5yr_gibbs.F90 [together with br_mod_dist.f90]
-- This module computes the low-l temperature likelihood by
using the Gibbs sampling. To use this, set "use_gibbs = .true." 
in wmap_options.F90.

** The following new compiler options (see Makefile) have been added:
WMAPFLAGS += -DUSE_LOWELL_TBEB
-- enable the pixel-based polarization likelihood option for TB/EB at l=2-23

WMAPFLAGS += -DUSE_HIGHELL_TB
-- enable the master likelihood option for TB at l=2-450


-----------------------------
CHANGE LOG FOR V2P2P2 RELEASE
-----------------------------
M.R.Nolta, November 2006

WMAP_3yr_tt_pixlike.F90:
-- Sped up the TT pixel likelihood module by a factor of 10 using
   signal-to-noise eigenvalue compression (suggested by Jon Sievers; see
   http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~sievers/WMAP3TTfaster/ for more details).
   To enable, set -DFASTERTT during compilation.

WMAP_3yr_likelihood.F90:
-- Minor bug fix; TE sanity check is now abs(TE)/sqrt(TT*EE)<1 instead of
   TE/sqrt(TT*EE)<1.
-- Moved fisher matrix from the stack to the heap to fix crash when using the
   XLF compiler.

WMAP_3yr_teeebb_pixlike.F90:
-- Added deallocation statements to fix crash when using the XLF compiler.

-----------------------------
CHANGE LOG FOR V2P2P1 RELEASE
-----------------------------
M.R.Nolta, October 2006

WMAP_3yr_likelihood.f90:
-- A beam error is now treated as a warning instead of an error.  Warnings are
   not fatal to a run; instead the correction is set to zero and the issue is
   reported.

WMAP_3yr_util.f90:
-- New status variables were added to track warnings and to indicate whether or
   not there were errors and/or warnings.
-- A subroutine was added to report warnings, and the error reporting subroutine
   was modified to also report warnings.


---------------------------
CHANGE LOG FOR V2P2 RELEASE
---------------------------
E.Komatsu & M.R.Nolta, October 2006

Makefile:
-- <healpix> removed. The code no longer needs installation of Healpix.
-- Added compile switches -DOPTIMIZE and -DOPTIMIZE2, which enable
   various speed and memory optimizations. -DOPTIMIZE streamlines the code
   in WMAP_3yr_teeebb_pixlike.f90 without changing the logic. It is enabled
   by default. When -DOPTIMIZE2 is defined some elements of the TT signal
   covariance matrix (in WMAP_3yr_tt_pixlike.f90) are found by interpolating
   the 2-pt correlation function C(theta). In tests this approximation changes
   -2lnL by O(0.01), but to be conservative -DOPTIMIZE2 is not enabled by
   default. If both -DOPTIMIZE and -DOPTIMIZE2 are enabled the code is twice
   as fast:

	pass2_compute_likelihood() run times (sec)
	------------------------------------------
	(no optimizations)		5.2722001
	-DOPTIMIZE			4.0882001
	-DOPTIMIZE -DOPTIMIZE2		2.6022999

   These times are from a dual Intel Xeon 2.4GHz node.
-- Added compile switch -DTIMING. If enabled the code prints out
   timing messages useful for gauging performance. Should not be
   enabled when running chains.


WMAP_3yr_options.f90:
-- character(len=*), parameter :: WMAP_data_dir = './data/'
                     ^^^^^^^^^ 
*** AN IMPORTANT CHANGE WITH REGARD TO THE RESOLUTION ***
The TT pixel likelihood code now supports either resolution 4 (nside=16) or 
resolution 3 (nside=8) for the input temperature map. The resolution 4 map
should be used for the most accurate results. On the other hand, the 
resolution 3 map runs much more quickly. Therefore, if you would like to use 
the resolution 3 map for testing your code, please change

	integer :: lowl_tt_res          = 4
	integer :: lowl_max             = 30
to 
	integer :: lowl_tt_res          = 3
	integer :: lowl_max             = 12

in WMAP_3yr_options.f90. MAKE SURE TO CHANGE BOTH lowl_tt_res AND lowl_max.


WMAP_3yr_likelihood.f90:
-- Now the code stops when the input clte/sqrt(cltt*clee) is greater than 1.
-- Invalidate the beam correction when ln(likelihood_beam) >=
   ln(likelihood_total)/4
-- Removed ptsrc and SZ spectra from wmap_likelihood_inputs_tt.dat file, and
   clps, clsz, and sz_amp from the code. The point-source marginalization is
   done in "WMAP_3yr_tt_beam_and_ptsrc_corr.f90". If you wish to include the
   SZ marginalization, download a "Predicted SZ Power Spectrum" file from
   LAMBDA and use the V-band prediction with its amplitude being marginalized.
   You may do it by adding an SZ contribution to the TT spectrum, cl_tt = cl_tt
   + sz_amp*clsz, and vary sz_amp. 
-- A constant offset, te_lndet_offset defined in WMAP_3yr_options.f90,
   is now subtracted from the raw TETE lndet term.


WMAP_3yr_teeebb_pixlike.f90:
-- Marginalization over polarized foreground errors has been added.
-- Pixel-window function is now provided as an ascii file.
-- Loss imbalance mode projected out of N^{-1}.
-- A constant offset, teeebb_pixlike_lndet_offset defined in
   WMAP_3yr_options.f90, is now subtracted from the raw EE/BB lndet term.
-- Added speed and memory optimizations, enabled by defining -DOPTIMIZE during
   compilation. 


WMAP_3yr_tt_beam_and_ptsrc_corr.f90:
-- ptsrc correction reduced by 18% and uncertainty doubled.
-- fixed bug triggered when lmin,lmax changed from default values of 2,1000.


WMAP_3yr_tt_pixlike.f90:
-- Healpix functions have been replaced by the pre-computed data.
   >> The ILC and V-band maps have been smoothed and degraded already.
   >> V1 and V2 maps have been coadded.
-- The res4 (nside=16) smoothing scale is 9.1831 degrees.
   (Note that the ILC map has already been smoothed by a 1-degree beam, so 
   the FWHM of an additional smoothing is 9.1285 degrees.)
-- The res3 (nside=8) smoothing scale is 18.3 degrees.
-- A white noise term (1uK per pixel at nside=8 or 16) is added to regularize
   S+N matrix.
-- Foreground marginalization using the difference between ILC and V-band maps
   is explicitly imposed.
-- Using res3 or res4 maps is an option (lowl_tt_res).
   MAKE SURE TO CHANGE lowl_max ALSO! lowl_max=30 and 12 are recommended for
   lowl_tt_res=4 and 3, respectively.
-- A constant offset, tt_pixlike_lndet_offset defined in WMAP_3yr_options.f90,
   is now subtracted from the raw TTTT lndet term.
-- Added optional faster approximate calculation of TT signal covariance matrix,
   enabled by defining -DOPTIMIZE2 during compilation.
