assumptions:
    - "Nonlinear or linear P(k,z) calculated at a small k value."

explanation: |
        "This simple module extracts the the linear growth factor D, and linear growth rate, from the matter power spectra
        It takes the z spacing from the input module
        "
params:
        input_section: "String, which input section (spectrum) to use (default=matter_power_nl)"
        output_section: "String, which output section to put the results in (default="
inputs: 
    matter_power_nl:
        k_h:  "Real 1D, wavenumbers of samples"
        z:  "Real 1D, Redshifts of samples"
        p_k:  "Real 2D, Matter power spectrum samples"

outputs:
    growth_parameters:
        d_z: "1D real array, linear growth factor D"
        f_z: "1D real array, linear growth rate f"
        z: "1D real array, redshift of samples "
