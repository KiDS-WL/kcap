explanation: |
    "
    Intrinsic alignment refers to the extent to which galaxies align in the sky,
    before any alignment induced by gravitational lensing.  It is a systematic
    error contribution to cosmic shear measurements and is predicted here in the form
    of two power spectra, one for the alignments, P_II, and one for the alignment-shear
    correlations, P_GI.

    In the original Linear Alignment model it was assumed that alignments among
    galaxies were laid down early in the evolution of structure, and then (on average)
    did not vary since.  The amount of alignment on a given scale was then related
    to the linear power spectrum at that scale.

    The P_II and P_GI power is described in terms of a power spectrum, integrated over
    with a Limber integral in a similar way to the shear power spectrum. This code
    does not do that integral, it just calculates P_II and P_GI.

    A number of variations to the LA model have been discussed since, and this module
    implements three of them.  The history is a little convoluted as an error was found
    in early work missing a factor of (1+z), so one of our models is a corrected version
    of one of the other ones.  Our models are:
        Bridle & King
        Bridle & King (corrected)
        Kirk, Rassat, Host, Bridle

    See these papers for details of these models.

params:
    method: "string, choice of 'bk', 'bk_corrected', 'krhb', chooses which model to run"
    name: "string, default is empty.  If set, save the outputs to sections with the name as a suffix, e.g intrinsic_power_NAME"
    grid_mode: "bool, default false. If set, save the fields b(k,z) and r(k,z) as described in Bridle & King instead of applying directly to P(k)"
