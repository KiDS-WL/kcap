I had to make a few changes to the code to generate what we needed for cosmosis:

parser.h: 
	increase _LINE_LENGTH_MAX_ and _ARGUMENT_LENGTH_MAX_ to 4096 so that we can specify a longer list of redshift values.


output.h:
	increase _Z_PK_NUM_MAX_ to 500 to allow more redshift values


Makefile: 
	general fiddles to use variables from the top-level Makefile.
