    The Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background, in equations_ppf mode

    CAMB is the standard cosmology code for evolving perturbations
    in the primordial universe into CMB and matter power spectra, as
    well as various auxiliary quantities.

    See http://camb.info for a fuller description

    It has a wide variety of options only a few of which are currently
    exposed here.  This will be extended in future.  This version of
    camb has been modified very slightly to output a few new pieces
    of data useful in other modules, notably the dark matter density
    history rho(z) (which can vary in non-lcdm models)

    Anthony Lewis has kindly given permission for CAMB to be packaged
    with CosmoSIS.

    The CosmoSIS team packaged this module into cosmosis form so any issues
    running it here please ask us first.


# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    mode: "String, choose from Background, thermal, cmb, or all. In background mode only the expansion history is calculated. In thermal mode the recombination history is computed and rs_zdrag and related quantities also. In cmb mode the CMB power spectra are also calculated. In all mode the matter power spectrum at low redshift and sigma8 are also calculated."
    lmax:  "Integer, only if mode!=background, default 1200 - the max ell to use for cmb calculation"
    feedback: "Integer, amount of output to print.  0 for no feedback.  1 for basic, 2 for extended, maybe higher?"
    use_tabulated_w: "Logical, set to true to load w(z) from previous module (default F)"

    zmax: "Max value to save P(k,z) (default 4)"
    nz: "Number of z values to save P(k,z) (default 401, so that dz=0.01)"

    do_lensing: "Include lensing of CMB, and save C_ell phi-phi (default F)"
    high_ell_template: "Required for lensing - set to the file included in the camb dir (no default)"
