assumptions:
    - Linear extrapolation in log-space of P(k); this is not a great approximation

explanation: |
  It is sometimes useful to extend matter power spectra P(k) to high values
  of k. These values are unphysical but are useful for numerical stability.

  This module does a simple linear extrapolation in log-log space of P(k)
  out to a specified kmin and kmax.  If the data already extends that far then
  it does not do anything.

  It tries both linear and non-linear spectra but does not complain if either or 
  both are not present.

params:
    kmax:  "real, the max wavenumber k to extrapolate to"
    kmin:  "real, the min wavenumber k to extrapolate to (default 1e10 - high enough for no extrapolation)"
    nmin:  "integer, the number of points to add at low k (default 50)"
    nmax:  "integer, the number of points to add at high k (default 200)"
    npoint: "integer, the number of end k-samples to use to fit the line at the end (default 3)"

inputs:
    matter_power_lin:
        z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
        k_h: "1D real array, inpu k wavenumbers of samples in Mpc/h."
        p_k: "2D real array, matter power spectrum at samples in (Mpc/h)^-3."
    matter_power_nl:
        z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
        k_h: "1D real array, inpu k wavenumbers of samples in Mpc/h."
        p_k: "2D real array, matter power spectrum at samples in (Mpc/h)^-3."

outputs:
    matter_power_lin:
        z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
        k_h: "1D real array, inpu k wavenumbers of samples in Mpc/h, extended to kmax"
        p_k: "2D real array, matter power spectrum at samples in (Mpc/h)^-3, extended to kmax"
    matter_power_nl:
        z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
        k_h: "1D real array, inpu k wavenumbers of samples in Mpc/h, extended to kmax"
        p_k: "2D real array, matter power spectrum at samples in (Mpc/h)^-3, extended to kmax"
