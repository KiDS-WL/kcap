explanation: |
    "It is often useful to apply a maximum or minimum ell cut to a CMB lensing map before measuring correlation functions with galaxies and shears.  If such an ell-cut is applied, we must account for it on the modeling side.  This module applies the lmin/lmax cut to the relevant cross-power spectra."

params:
    shearkappa_section: "section name where harmonic-space cross-spectrum between galaxy shear and CMB kappa is stored.  Leave blank if none."
    galkappa_section: "section name where harmonic-space cross-spectrum between galaxy density and CMB kappa is stored.  Leave blank if none." 
    Lmin: "minimum ell to impose for CMB kappa cross-spectra."
    Lmax: "maximum ell to impose for CMB kappa cross-spectra."


inputs:
    shear_cmbkappa_cl:
        ell: "integer 1d array, values at which c_ell is evaluated"
        bin_{i}_{j}: "real 1d arrays for relevant i and j combinations.  C_ell calculated at corresponding ell."
    galaxy_cmbkappa_cl:
        ell: "integer 1d array, values at which c_ell is evaluated"
        bin_{i}_{j}: "real 1d arrays for relevant i and j combinations.  C_ell calculated at corresponding ell."

outputs:

        ell: "integer 1d array, values at which c_ell is evaluated"
        bin_{i}_{j}: "real 1d arrays for relevant i and j combinations.  C_ell calculated at corresponding ell after smoothing."
