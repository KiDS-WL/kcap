assumptions:
    - "Gaussian window in redshift"

explanation: |
    "This very simple module sets up fixed redshift n(z) bins for weak lensing.
     We should probably upgrade it to take the redshift and sigma from the 
     sampling instead of the ini file."

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    z: "Real scalar or vector; redshift(s) of the bins"
    sigma: "Real scalar or vector; width of the bins in redshift"

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs: {}

outputs:
    wl_number_density:
        nz: "Integer; number of redshift samples"
        nbin: "Integer; number of bins"
        z: "Real vector; redshift sample values"
        bin_: "Real vector; n(z) at redshift sample values.  bin_1, bin_2, ..."
