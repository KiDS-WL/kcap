#This is a template for module description files
name: load_nz
version: 1
purpose: Load a number density n(z) for weak lensing from a file

rules: "If you use a file from a particular survey you should cite that survey"

assumptions:
    - "n(z) file first column = z, others = bin n(z)"

explanation: |
    "This simple module just loads a set of n(z) for different bins from a
    fixed file and provides it as-is.  The n(z) are normalized before being saved."

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    filepath: "String; absolute or relative path to an n(z) file"
    des_fmt: "Bool, default=F; use the DES format n(z) with columns zmin, zmax, nz1, nz2..."
    histogram: "Bool, default=F; Assume that the given z values are lower edges of histogram bins, not sample points."
    output_section: "String, default ''wl_number_density''. The section to which to save the output."
#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs: {}

outputs:
    output_section:
        nz: "Integer; number of redshift samples. By default all these will go in wl_number_density."
        nbin: "Integer; number of bins"
        z: "Real vector; redshift sample values"
        bin_: "Real vector; n(z) at redshift sample values.  bin_1, bin_2, ..."
