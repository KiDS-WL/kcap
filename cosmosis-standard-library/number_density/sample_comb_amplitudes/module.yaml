assumptions:
    - "Simple photo-z bias models: n(z) -> n(z-b) or n(z*(1-b))"

explanation: |
    Photometric redshift distributions can contain biases - the actual distribution
    of galaxies in a survey can be different to the estimated one.

    This bias can remain even after calibration with a spectroscopic sample, or by other methods.

    This module models the simplest possible type of n(z) bias - a simple shift in z by a multiplicative
    or additive factor. The idea is that the shift parameter should be marginalized in sampling over to 
    account for this bias.  Note that this is *not* the same as simply widening the n(z).

    Ranges or priors should be put on the size of the bias that reflect your knowledge of remaining
    possible biases.

    The mode is:
    n(z) -> n(z-b) or n(z*(1-b))

params:
    mode: "String; 'multiplicative' or 'additive', depending on what kind of bias model you want"
    sample: "String, optional; If set, look for n(z) in the section called sample, and error parameters in sample_errors"
    bias_section: "String, optional; If set, look for input parameters in this named section instead of wl_photoz_errors. If not set but sample is set, look in sample_errors"
    interpolation: "String, default=cubic. Type of interpolation to use in scipy.interpolate.interp1d"
    per_bin: "Bool, default=T. Use one value per bin, if False, one value for all bins"

inputs:
    wl_number_density:
        nbin: Integer; number of redshift bins
        z: Real vector; redshift sample points of n(z) estimates
        bin_i: Real vectors; for i=1..nbin. n(z) estimates

    wl_photoz_errors:
        bias_i: Real; for i=1..nbin if per_bin=T or i=0 otherwise. Bias size for this bin.

outputs:
    wl_number_density:
        bin_i: Real vectors; for i=1..nbin. Modified n(z) estimates replaced old value
