assumptions:
    - "The galaxy luminosity function is well approximated by the fitting function of Blake & Bridle (2005)."
    - "The limiting r-band magnitude r_lim>16.9 "

explanation: |
    "
    The gradient of the cumulative galaxy luminosity function \alpha is sensitive to both redshift and magnitude limit of the survey 
    considered. Joachimi & Bridle (2010) extend the fitting function of Blake & Bridle (2005) to obtain a polynomial \alpha(z, r_lim) 
    at a range of redshifts, where z_i is the median in redshift bin i and r_lim is the r-band magnitude limit. Note that the fitting is based on ground-based
    data from the COMBO-17 survey. See Joachimi & Bridle (2010) for discussion of its applicability.

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module
params:
        magnitude_limit: "double; limiting r-band magnitude of the survey considered. default=24"
        binned_alpha: "bool; compute alpha in the survey redshift bins, rather than as a continuous funtion of redshift. default=True"

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs:
    wl_num_density:
        Nz: "integer; number of points used to evaluate the distribution in each redshift bin."
        nzbin: "integer; number of survey redshift bins."
        zmax: "double; maximum redshift of the redshift distributions."
        bin_i: "real vector; an array of Nz points evenly sampled from the galaxy redshift distribution in bin i in the range z={0...zmax}. The index ranges i={0,1...nzbin}."

outputs:
    galaxy_luminosity_function:
        z: "real vector; redshift values of alpha(z) samples"
        alpha: "real vector; gradient of the logarithmic cumulative galaxy luminosity function at the limiting magnitude."
        z_binned: "real vector; median values of the n(z) in the survey redshift bins."
        alpha_binned: "real vector; gradient of the logarithmic cumulative galaxy luminosity function at the limiting magnitude, evaluated at the median redshift of each bin."
