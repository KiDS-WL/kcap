assumptions:
    - "Simple multiplicative shear bias model: C^{ij}_ell -> (1+m_i)(1+m_j) C^{ij}_ell"

explanation: |
    Errors in cosmic shear measurement can lead to a multiplicative factor
    scaling the observed shear spectra.

    This module scales the measured C_ell to account for that difference,
    assuming model values of the multiplicative factor m, either per bin or for all bins.

    Since the bias can be different in different bins we have, for the general case
    including cross-spectra:

    C^{ij}_ell -> (1+m_i)(1+m_j) C^{ij}_ell

params:
    m_per_bin: "Boolean; default=T, If T use a separate m for each bin, otherwise a single global one"

inputs:
    wl_number_density:
        nbin: "Integer, number of tomographic bins."
    shear_calibration_parameters:
        m0: "Real; only if m_per_bin=F. The multiplicative bias for all the bins/"
        m_i: "Integer; only if m_per_bin=F; for i=1..nbin. The multiplicative bias for each bin."
    shear_cl:
        bin_i_j: "Real vector; for i and j=1..nbin. Shear power spectrum."

outputs:
    shear_cl:
        bin_i_j: "Real vector; for i and j=1..nbin. Modified shear power spectrum."
