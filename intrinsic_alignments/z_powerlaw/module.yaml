assumptions:
    - "Modify the intrinsic alignment power spectra to have a power-law dependence in (1+z)"

explanation: |
    "
    Basic models of intrinsic alignments assume a specific simple evolution with redshift.
    This module takes an existing model of the IA power spectra and modifies them by giving
    them additional evolution in z.

    Specifically, it takes P_II and P_GI (e.g. as calculated by the la_model module)
    and modifies them to:

    P_II(k,z) -> (1+z)^alpha P_II(k,z)
    P_GI(k,z) -> (1+z)^alpha P_GI(k,z)
