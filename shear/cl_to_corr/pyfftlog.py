`pyfftlog` -- Python version of FFTLog
======================================

This is a Python version of the FFTLog Fortran code by Andrew Hamilton:

Hamilton, A. J. S., 2000, Uncorrelated modes of the non-linear power spectrum:
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 312, pages 257-284; DOI:
10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03071.x; Website of FFTLog:
http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog.

The function `scipy.special.loggamma` replaces the file `cdgamma.f` in the
original code, and the functions `rfft` and `irfft` from `scipy.fftpack`
replace the files `drffti.f`, `drfftf.f`, and `drfftb.f` in the original code.

The original documentation has just been adjusted where necessary, and put into
a more pythonic format (e.g. using 'Parameters' and 'Returns' in the
documentation').

 THE FFTLog CODE
===============================================================================

FFTLog
    computes the discrete Fast Fourier Transform or Fast Hankel Transform (of
    arbitrary real index) of a periodic logarithmic sequence.

Version of 5 July 1999.

FFTLog computes a discrete version of the Hankel Transform (= Fourier-Bessel
Transform) with a power law bias (k r)^q

            infinity
            /           q
    ã(k) = | a(r) (k r)  J  (k r) k dr
            /              mu
            0

            infinity
            /           -q
    a(r) = | ã(k) (k r)   J  (k r) r dk
            /               mu
            0

where J_mu is the Bessel function of order mu.  The index mu may be any real
number, positive or negative.

The input array a_j is a periodic sequence of length n, uniformly
logarithmically spaced with spacing dlnr
    a_j = a(r_j)   at   r_j = r_c exp[(j-j_c) dlnr]
centred about the point r_c.  The central index j_c = (n+1)/2 is 1/2 integral
if n is even.  Similarly, the output array ã_j is a periodic sequence of length
n, also uniformly logarithmically spaced with spacing dlnr
    ã_j = ã(k_j)   at   k_j = k_c exp[(j-j_c) dlnr]
centred about the point k_c.

The centre points r_c and k_c of the periodic intervals may be chosen
arbitrarily; but it would be normal to choose the product
    kr = k_c r_c = k_j r_(n+1-j) = k_(n+1-j) r_j
to be about 1 (or 2, or pi, to taste).

The FFTLog algorithm is (see Hamilton 2000):
1. FFT the input array a_j to obtain the Fourier coefficients c_m ;
2. Multiply c_m by
        u_m = (kr)^[- i 2 m pi/(n dlnr)] U_mu[q + i 2 m pi/(n dlnr)]
    where
        U_mu(x) = 2^x Gamma[(mu+1+x)/2] / Gamma[(mu+1-x)/2]
    to obtain c_m u_m ;
3. FFT c_m u_m back to obtain the discrete Hankel transform ã_j .

The Fourier sine and cosine transforms

                    infinity
                        /
    Ã(k) = sqrt(2/pi) | A(r) sin(k r) dr
                        /
                    0

                    infinity
                        /
    Ã(k) = sqrt(2/pi) | A(r) cos(k r) dr
                        /
                    0

may be regarded as special cases of the Hankel transform with mu = 1/2 and -1/2
since

    sqrt(2/pi) sin(x) = sqrt(x) J   (x)
                                1/2

    sqrt(2/pi) cos(x) = sqrt(x) J    (x)
                                -1/2

The Fourier transforms may be done by making the substitutions
                q-(1/2)                      -q-(1/2)
    A(r) = a(r) r          and   Ã(k) = ã(k) k

and Hankel transforming a(r) with a power law bias (k r)^q

            infinity
            /           q
    ã(k) = | a(r) (k r)  J    (k r) k dr
            /              ±1/2
            0

Different choices of power law bias q lead to different discrete Fourier
transforms of A(r), because the assumption of periodicity of a(r) = A(r)
r^[-q+(1/2)] is different for different q.

If A(r) is a power law, A(r) proportional to r^[q-(1/2)], then applying a bias
q yields a discrete Fourier transform Ã(k) that is exactly equal to the
continuous Fourier transform, because then a(r) is a constant, which is a
periodic function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hankel transform

            infinity
            /
    Ã(k) = | A(r) J  (k r) k dr
            /       mu
            0

may be done by making the substitutions
                q                      -q
    A(r) = a(r) r    and   Ã(k) = ã(k) k

and Hankel transforming a(r) with a power law bias (k r)^q

            infinity
            /           q
    ã(k) = | a(r) (k r)  J  (k r) k dr
            /              mu
            0

Different choices of power law bias q lead to different discrete Hankel
transforms of A(r), because the assumption of periodicity of a(r) = A(r) r^-q
is different for different q.

If A(r) is a power law, A(r) proportional to r^q, then applying a bias q yields
a discrete Hankel transform Ã(k) that is exactly equal to the continuous Hankel
transform, because then a(r) is a constant, which is a periodic function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------
There are five routines:
------------------------
Comments in the subroutines contain further details.

(1) subroutine fhti(n,mu,q,dlnr,kr,kropt,wsave,ok)
    is an initialization routine.

(2) subroutine fftl(n,a,rk,dir,wsave)
    computes the discrete Fourier sine or cosine transform of a logarithmically
    spaced periodic sequence. This is a driver routine that calls fhtq.

(3) subroutine fht(n,a,dir,wsave)
    computes the discrete Hankel transform of a logarithmically spaced periodic
    sequence.  This is a driver routine that calls fhtq.

(4) subroutine fhtq(n,a,dir,wsave)
    computes the biased discrete Hankel transform of a logarithmically spaced
    periodic sequence.  This is the basic FFTLog routine.

(5) real*8 function krgood(mu,q,dlnr,kr)
    takes an input kr and returns the nearest low-ringing kr.  This is an
    optional routine called by fhti.

    fhti initializes the working array xsave used by fftl, fht, and fhtq.  fhti
    need be called once, whereafter fftl, fht, or fhtq may be called many
    times, as long as n, mu, q, dlnr, and kr remain unchanged. fhti should be
    called each time n, mu, q, dlnr, or kr is changed. The work array xsave
    should not be changed between calls to fftl, fht, or fhtq.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of points in the array to be transformed; n may be any positive
        integer, but the FFT routines run fastest if n is a product of small
        primes 2, 3, 5.

    mu : float
        Index of J_mu in Hankel transform; mu may be any real number, positive
        or negative.

    dlnr : float
        Separation between natural log of points; dlnr may be positive or
        negative.

    q : float, optional
        Exponent of power law bias; q may be any real number, positive or
        negative.  If in doubt, use q = 0, for which case the Hankel transform
        is orthogonal, i.e. self-inverse, provided also that, for n even, kr is
        low-ringing.  Non-zero q may yield better approximations to the
        continuous Hankel transform for some functions.
        Defaults to 0 (unbiased).

    kr : float, optional
        k_c r_c where c is central point of array
        = k_j r_(n+1-j) = k_(n+1-j) r_j .
        Normally one would choose kr to be about 1 (default) (or 2, or pi, to
        taste).

    kropt : int, optional; {0, 1, 2, 3}
        - 0 to use input kr as is (default);
        - 1 to change kr to nearest low-ringing kr, quietly;
        - 2 to change kr to nearest low-ringing kr, verbosely;
        - 3 for option to change kr interactively.

    Returns
    -------
    kr : float, optional
        kr, adjusted depending on kropt.

    xsave : array
        Working array used by fftl, fht, and fhtq. Dimension:
        - for q = 0 (unbiased transform): n+3
        - for q != 0 (biased transform): 1.5*n+4

       A(r) = a(r) r    and   Ã(k) = ã(k) k

    and applying a biased Hankel transform to a(r).

    The steps are:

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array
        Array A(r) to transform: a(j) is A(r_j) at r_j = r_c exp[(j-jc) dlnr],
        where jc = (n+1)/2 = central index of array.

    Use of this routine is optional.

    Choosing kr so that
        (kr)^(- i pi/dlnr) U_mu(q + i pi/dlnr)
    is real may reduce ringing of the discrete Hankel transform, because it
    makes the transition of this function across the period boundary smoother.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mu : float
        index of J_mu in Hankel transform; mu may be any real number, positive
        or negative.

    q : float
        exponent of power law bias; q may be any real number, positive or
        negative.  If in doubt, use q = 0, for which case the Hankel transform
        is orthogonal, i.e. self-inverse, provided also that, for n even, kr is
        low-ringing.  Non-zero q may yield better approximations to the
        continuous Hankel transform for some functions.

    dlnr : float
        separation between natural log of points; dlnr may be positive or
        negative.

    kr : float, optional
        k_c r_c where c is central point of array
        = k_j r_(n+1-j) = k_(n+1-j) r_j .
        Normally one would choose kr to be about 1 (default) (or 2, or pi, to
        taste).
