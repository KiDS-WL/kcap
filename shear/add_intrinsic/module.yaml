assumptions:
    - "Linear sum of C_ell for IA components"

explanation: |
    Observerd shape spectra contain a sum of intrinsic and shear spectra, and the
    cross-correlation between them.  This module adds together these components,
    accounting for the fact that C_GI != C_IG for two bins

    It may be replaced at some point with changes to the shear computation modules.

params: {}

inputs:
    shear_cl_gg:
        nbin:  "Integer; number of tomographic bins"
        ell:  "Real 1D array; ell samples of theory"
        bin_{i}_{j}:  "Real 1D array; for series of i,j values, the shear-shear angular spectra C_ell"
    shear_cl_ii:
        bin_{i}_{j}:  "Real 1D array; for series of i,j values, the intrinsic-intrinsic angular spectra C_ell"
    shear_cl_gi:
        bin_{i}_{j}:  "Real 1D array; for series of i,j values, the shear-intrinsic angular spectra C_ell"
        bin_{j}_{i}:  "Real 1D array; for series of i,j values, the intrinsic_shear angular spectra C_ell"


outputs:
    shear_cl:
        nbin:  "Integer; number of tomographic bins"
        ell:  "Real 1D array; ell samples of theory"
        bin_{i}_{j}:  "Real 1D array; for series of i,j values, the total angular spectra C_ell"
