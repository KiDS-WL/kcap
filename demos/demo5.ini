[emcee]
; The emcee sampler uses the concept of walkers, a collection
; of live points.  Sampling is done along lines that connect
; pairs of walkers.  The number of walkers must be at least
; 2*nparam + 1, but in general more than that usually works
; better.
walkers = 64
; This many samples is overkill, just to make the plots
; look a lot nicer
samples = 400
; This is the interval at which convergence diagnostics
; are performed
nsteps = 100
