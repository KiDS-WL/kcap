assumptions:
    - The modified gravity phenomenological model described in the referenced papers

explanation: |
    ISiTGR, the Integrated Software in Testing General Relativity, is
    a set of modifications to CAMB and CosmoMC which implement a set of modified
    gravity models where the perturbed metric quantities phi and psi are
    modified by some fitting functions as a general, phenomenological model
    of some unknown new physics.

    There are a number of possible ways to describe such functions; this 
    code uses the variables in equations 8 and 10 of http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4583v3.pdf
    and the functional form ansatz in equation 11:

    For X as Q, D, or R we use:
        X(k,a) = [X_0 exp(-k/k_c) + X_inf (1-exp(-k/k_c)) - 1] a^s + 1

    Most of the parameters in this code are the same as those in camb; see
    the camb module information for more details.

    ISiTGR is pronounced "Is it GR?" not "Easy, Tiger".

    Anthony Lewis has kindly given permission for CAMB to be packaged
    with CosmoSIS.

    The CosmoSIS team packaged this module into cosmosis form so any issues
    running it here please ask us first.


# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    scale_dependent: "logical. Use scale dependent parameterized functions.  If False, k_c is ignored." 
    use_r_function: "logical.  Give R scale and time dependence instead of Q."
    mode:
        String, choose from Background, thermal, cmb, or all.

        In background mode only the expansion history is calculated.
        In thermal mode the recombination history is computed and rs_zdrag and related quantities also.
        In cmb mode the CMB power spectra are also calculated.
        In all mode the matter power spectrum at low redshift and sigma8 are also calculated.
    lmax:  "Integer, only if mode!=background, default 1200 - the max ell to use for cmb calculation"
    feedback: "Integer, amount of output to print.  0 for no feedback.  1 for basic, 2 for extended, maybe higher?"
    use_tabulated_w: "Logical, set to true to load w(z) from previous module (default F)"
    k_eta_max_scalar: "Integer, maximum value of (k eta) to evolve for scalars. (default 2*lmax)"
    do_tensors: "Include tensor modes (default F) "
    zmin: "Min value to save P(k,z) (default 0)"
    zmax: "Max value to save P(k,z) (default 4)"
    nz: "Number of z values to save P(k,z) (default 401, so that dz=0.01)"
    do_nonlinear: "Apply non-linear halofit corrections to matter-power.  Relevant only for lensing right now (default F)"
    do_lensing: "Include lensing of CMB, and save C_ell phi-phi (default F)"
    high_ell_template: "Required for lensing - set to the file included in the camb dir (no default)"
